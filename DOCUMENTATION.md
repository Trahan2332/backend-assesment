# Documentation
Create a RESTful API to Create and Read message threads.

NOTE: Used EXPRESS app instead of NestJS on account of the learning curve
-

Focused on basics of building the API, connecting to a database (hosted in docker), and centralizing error and successful message handlers. Attempted to focus on separation of concerns (services, models, routes) and single responsibility functions.


### Future Work
- Compete api routes successfully.
- Implement recursive searching in SQL query
- Verify error/success responses are centralized and working
- Evaluate the efficacy of the database schema (I'm sure there are other techniques)
- Implement unit testing
